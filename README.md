**1. SPA with a basic interface.**

It is preferable to use AngularJS / Angular.

The user interface should be able to handle the following:

  - Import sales records

    - Upload a file from UI

  - Show imported records with pagination inside a grid

    - Sort records in grid by order date

    - Filter imported records in grid by country

  - Modifying imported sales records:

    - Edit a sales record (you can choose one):

      - either inline within the grid itself or

      - via a pop-up form which will display the relevant order details

    - Delete imported sales record one by one or in bulk

  - Aggregate the sales records to display the number of orders and total profit by country
and year

    - User should be able to see how many orders have been sold in the specific
country for a specific year

    - User should be able to see what profit has been earned in the specific country for
a specific year


**NEW FEATURES - NOT DONE YET**
These optional tasks are for candidates who would like to demonstrate their skills further:

  -  User authorisation

     - The only authorised user can import sales records

  - Show progress bar with percentage for long operations

  - Handle uploading several files from UI:

    - If a record already exists in the Storage, it should be updated in the storage

    - If the record does not exist in the Storage, the new record should be added to the
storage
